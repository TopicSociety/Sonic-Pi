# Beijing Leaves You
# coded by Topic Society

# This work is a reaction to the recent incidents
# and is inspired by Come Out,
# a 1966 piece composed by Steve Reith
# to fight for the civil rights of the black people.
# Today, it is very upsetting to see
# how Chinese are treated in our own country as second-class citizen.
# Beijing, the place once welcomed you, hates you now.
# Sampled from interview audio clip,
# the work is about out-of-place, disorientation, and desynchronization,
# as what you will hear.
